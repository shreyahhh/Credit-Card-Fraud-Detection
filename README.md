 The project uses various data analytics techniques for credit card fraud detection, including outlier detection, scaling, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
1. OUTLIER DETECTION :
   Z-score method is used to identify outliers by calculating the Z-score for each data point.
3. SCALING :
   Min-Max Scaling technique scales the features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1], to prevent dominance of a single feature.
4. FEATURE ENGINEERING :
   Only relevant numerical columns are selected to focus on the most informative features.
5. MODEL TRAINING :
   Supervised learning techniques such as DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, and LOGISTIC REGRESSION are used.
6. PREDICTION ADN FRAUD DETECTION :
   Models make predictions on new transaction data, and an ensemble approach is used to combine predictions from multiple models for improved fraud detection.
7. PERFORMANCE METRICES :
   Metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are used to evaluate the performance of classification models.
8. DATA VISUALIZATION :
   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand data distribution, detect anomalies, and gain insights into relationships between different features using visualization tools like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
